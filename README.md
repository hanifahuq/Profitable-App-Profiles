# Profitable-App-Profiles
 
 In this project, I will determine which categories of free apps can generate revenue relying on in-app advertisement by analysing data containing information on apps found on Google and iOS app markets.

Data Sources:

Google Play Store - https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps

iOS App Store - https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps

Completed with guidance from dataquest: https://www.dataquest.io/
